# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis  
End-to-end data analytics case study using SQL (PostgreSQL), R, Excel (Power Query), and Tableau.  
**Time Period Analyzed:** October 2024 – September 2025  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes Cyclistic’s bike-share usage patterns to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** differ in their riding behavior. Insights were used to create data-backed marketing recommendations aimed at increasing annual memberships.

The workflow follows the Google Data Analytics framework:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

## 🧭 ASK  
### **Business Task**  
Identify behavioral differences between casual and member riders to help Cyclistic’s marketing team convert casual riders into annual subscribers.

### **Key Questions**
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  
2. What motivates casual riders, and how can Cyclistic encourage them to subscribe?  
3. How can digital strategies influence conversion behavior?

## 🗂 PREPARE  
### **Data Source**  
Cyclistic trip data from **Oct 2024 to Sept 2025**, publicly provided by Motivate International Inc. under a usage license.  
Each monthly dataset includes:  
- Trip timestamps  
- Bike type used  
- Start & end stations + coordinates  
- Rider type (member/casual)

### **Data Organization**
12 massive CSVs, each representing one month of trips.  
Important columns include:  
`ride_id`, `rideable_type`, `started_at`, `ended_at`,  
`start_station_name`, `end_station_name`,  
`start_lat`, `start_lng`, `end_lat`, `end_lng`,  
`member_casual`

## ⚙ PROCESS  
### **Tools Used**
- **PostgreSQL** → Data ingestion, cleaning, transformations, EDA  
- **R** → Validation, visualization, analysis document  
- **Excel (Power Query)** → Additional transformations  
  - *Note:* The original dataset is extremely large (~5.6M+ rows).  
    Excel was only used via **Power Query** to avoid row-limit issues and crashes.  
- **Tableau** → Visualization & dashboard  
- **PowerPoint** → Final storytelling & presentation

### **Data Cleaning Steps**
- Removed missing/invalid station IDs, coordinates, and blank entries  
- Excluded rides with negative duration or duartions < 1 minute and durations > 24 hours  
- Created fields: `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, `month`  
- Validated primary key uniqueness (ride_id)  
- Ensured timestamp consistency  
- Checked for duplicates (none found)

## 📊 ANALYZE

### Behavior Insights
- Casual riders take **longer rides** but **ride less frequently**  
- Members ride **short, consistent, commute-based trips**  
- Weekend spikes indicate leisure-driven casual riders  
- Weekday AM/PM spikes indicate member commuters  

### Bike Type Usage
- Casual riders show higher average ride durations on both **classic** and **electric** bikes  
- Members use both bike types for **shorter, faster trips**, consistent with commuting behavior  

### Temporal Patterns
- Casual use peaks in **summer weekends**  
- Member activity aligns with **work routines**

All SQL queries and analysis scripts are provided in the `sql_scripts` and `r_analysis` folders.
